# Welcome to my first attempt at React!

Hi League Digital! Thank you for this opportunity to show some of my skills (Even though I only started with React 4 days ago :smile:)


This was a really fun project and I learnt a whole new side of web dev.


# Project

This project was done in React, primarily using Express, MongoDB, Material Design for React, Redux and Thunk.

## Hosting

The project is currently hosted on Heroku. You are more than welcome to test it out at [http://shaun.software](http://shaun.software) (please do give it a couple of seconds [or even refresh] when it loads the first time, the free dyno  might need to create a new instance).

## Conclusion

Please do excuse the messy code, I am very keen to master React soon and improve on this. I would really appreciate any feedback you are willing to send my way :beers:

Kind regards
Shaun
